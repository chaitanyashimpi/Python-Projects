 What will be covered in this Repo:
==========================

```Python projects using different Packages```

Introfuction to Python:
==========================
Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language. Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages. Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written.

Python used PIP (Python Pakage Manager) to store the python packages which can be installed to have different functionalities in the project.


Introduction to PIP:
==========================
So, what is pip? pip is a package manager for Python. That means it’s a tool that allows you to install and manage additional libraries and dependencies that are not distributed as part of the standard library.

How to Install Python:
==========================
Download a proper version of Python from [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Confirm the python is installed using following command

```python --version```

How to Install Pip:
==========================

Pip is installed by default on many newer Python builds. To check and see if it is already installed on our system, open a command prompt and type the following command.

```pip --version```

If you see the version of PIP then it is already installed, else follow the following steps,

In windows,

```python get-pip.py```

In Linux,

```sudo apt install python-pip```

To upgrade Pip,

```python -m pip install --upgrade pip```

To downgrade Pip,

```python -m pip install pip==18.0```
